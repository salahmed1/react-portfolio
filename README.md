## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Decisions

This project was intentionally migrated from a vanilla JavaScript codebase to a modern React architecture to showcase best practices in frontend development.

-   **Component Modularity:** The application is broken down into small, single-responsibility components (e.g., `Hero`, `Timeline`, `Modal`), making the codebase easier to reason about and scale.
-   **Scoped Styling:** CSS Modules were chosen over a single global stylesheet to prevent class name collisions and to co-locate component styles with their logic. This ensures that a change in one component's style cannot accidentally break another.
-   **Custom Hooks:** Logic for UI state, such as scroll visibility (`useScrollVisibility`), was extracted into custom hooks to keep components clean and the logic reusable (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself).
